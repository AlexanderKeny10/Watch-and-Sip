## Objective
1.	Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
2.	Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
3.	Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
4.	Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
5.	Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
6.	Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
7.	Have a polished UI.
8.	Be responsive.
9.	Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)
10.	Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
11.	Include authentication (express-session and cookies)
12.	Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
13. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
14. Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Description/Usage: 
WATCH & SIP is an entertainment search app that allows the user to search for films, television shows and cocktails.

## Approach
MVC Paradigm

## Final Statements/ Conclusion
- Had a difficult time finding an API that didn't have lengthy rules for usage
- Swithed to Axios method instead of Fetch for the routes 
- Installed and tried to implement Lodash, Sequelize-CLI(broke our code multiple times) and finally Tabulator, but ultimately switched to Chalk and Ora as to not break our functioning code
